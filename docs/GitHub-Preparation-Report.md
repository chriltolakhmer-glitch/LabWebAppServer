# GITHUB PREPARATION REPORT

Date: 2026-09-26. Status: source preparation and local validation complete; no GitHub repository created, commit made, remote added, or push performed. No running application, IIS setting, database, LabAuthServer file or operational configuration was changed.

## Repository

- Repository path: `C:\Apps\LabWebAppServer\Source\LabWebAppServer`
- Proposed GitHub repository name: `LabWebAppServer`
- Existing Git state: independent repository on unborn `master`, no commits, no tracked/staged files, no remotes. Source remains untracked for review before the initial commit.
- Layout already includes `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, README and ignore file; no relocation was needed. Matches LabAuthServer's inner source-repository approach, not its outer operational directory.

## Files added by preparation

- `src/LabWebAppServer.Web/appsettings.Development.example.json`
- `docs/configuration/labweb-runtime.example.json`
- `docs/Development-Rules.md`
- `docs/GitHub-Preparation-Report.md` (this record)

Updated README, AGENTS.md and .gitignore. Updated the executable csproj to exclude local settings and templates from publish output. API additionally has the root configuration placeholder change. Existing application code, migrations and tests were preserved.

## Exclusions and audit

Ignored: local/environment appsettings, runtime JSON, secrets/.env, certificate and key exports, Data Protection key files, database files/backups, Postman environments/globals/run exports, IDE files, binaries, bin/obj, logs, test results, publish output, archives, Current/Releases/Backups/Staging/Temp. Examples remain eligible. Static JavaScript/CSS dependencies and their licenses remain source assets.

Outer deployment directories are outside the Git root; do not initialize or upload from the operational parent. No Postman collection was found inside this source repository. No raw external Postman files were imported. Existing local Development JSON stays on disk but is ignored and not published.

Secrets detected in candidate source: **no confirmed passwords, credential-bearing connection strings, private keys, JWTs or access tokens**. Gitleaks/TruffleHog are unavailable. A fallback pattern scan inspected all candidate text files, including vendored text, for private-key headers, JWTs, common provider tokens, password connection strings and credential JSON properties; all matches were reviewed. This is a scoped heuristic scan, not an exhaustive guarantee. Git history has no commits to scan. Historical records retain internal host/account/path references; they are evidence, not secrets or runtime defaults, and should be reviewed before any public publication.

- No production credentials or signing material were found in candidate Web source. The regex scan's three password matches were `Input.Password = string.Empty` assignments, not credentials.
- Existing localhost defaults remain development-only. Runtime/development examples contain placeholders and README explains the actual API/Web launch ports and required overrides.
- Existing tests do not replace role-specific browser and deployed acceptance. The supplied external Postman result (67 passing assertions) is prior evidence, not a rerun of this prepared source.

## Validation

- SDK: 10.0.401.
- Release restore/build: PASS, zero warnings and errors.
- Tests: PASS: 8 passed, 0 failed; live browser/credentialed acceptance NOT RUN.
- Publish validation: PASS to `C:\Apps\Temp\GitHubPreparation-20260926\LabWebAppServer`; no environment/example appsettings were included. These are temporary validation outputs, not deployed releases.
- Git status and ignore checks: PASS; representative secret, runtime, deployment, binary and Postman paths are excluded; templates are included.
- Candidate JSON parse validation: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: no errors, but there are no tracked files, so this is not a substantive source diff check.
- Live/Postman release acceptance: NOT RUN during preparation. SQL data and deployment were not modified.

## Remaining issues and next boundary

Before a release, run the documented SQL/system/Postman acceptance against the exact candidate artifact and each required role, including cleanup. Bring sanitized external collection source into version control when reviewed. Historical cross-repository/absolute links in plans still describe the original workspace; README supplies standalone setup guidance. Root settings/launch files are documented legacy scaffolds.

Before an initial commit, review the full candidate file list and staged content, including historical internal metadata. No repository visibility or license grant was selected. GitHub creation and pushing remain intentionally unperformed under the user's instruction.
